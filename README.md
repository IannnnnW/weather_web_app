This simple Application uses the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data based on a particular town input and returns 
the weather conditions in that particular town. The conditions include, the description, the wind speed, the maximum
temperature, the minimum temperature and the humidity details. Two end points were used, the first was the geocoder
end point and then the weather condition end point.
